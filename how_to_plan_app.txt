that benveloent play.

search button fo shure.
when arriving on the landing page, we have a home page with
full width of page picture of a stage with velvet drapes, and
we'll have a carosel like application of pages so if one doesn't understand the concept of
the opera picture, we would also have an a sympthony like photo,
and the last photo would be...
google maps implemented (directions, pre-show drinks, post-show drinks)
picture of venue.
about the venue. historic, new?
seating arrangements if seats need to be purchased, or just general admission
maybe a globe (world map) like area with brite colors determining your area, and the theaters in
the area?

the app is subject to take about 4 months to build from the ground up, as
I'll need to compile data, and search state by state the local theaters.
from there, i'll have a layout of what I'd like the site to look like.
