git information

git is a powerful version control system, really. it's a remarkable tool used
to store different versions of files. from the jump, head over to github.com
and create a new repository, and since we aren't paying for private, please
make the repo public, which simply allows the masses to view the files.
create the name of the repo, and initialize it with a README.md file. we also
add a .gitignore file, and .gitignore is rather interesting, as .gitignore
stores files, though, they're hidden. being, the owner can see the files.
however, the outsiders can't. pretty fucking cool. wooo wooo!

okay, now for the nitty gritty, right.

here goes:

from the top: first push to git!

touch file name
git init
git add file name
git commit -m "first commit and or change"
git remote add origin repo name
git push -u origin master

second push and moving forward. holla
git status
git add file-name
git commit -m "changes made"
git push

on branching with git

git checkout -b new_branch_name --create the new branch and checks out
git checkout master
git checkout new_branch_home

sending change from code from clone back up to github?
at first, we need permission from the owners repo.
